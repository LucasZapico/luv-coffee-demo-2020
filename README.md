</h1>

This was a power demo a-z. This means in a short time frame I designed the logo, color pallette, imagery and illustration and developed what you see here.

> If you find an issue (spelling lol) want to suggest an improvement or just some feedback open an [issue on github](https://github.com/LucasZapico/luv-coffee-demo-2020/issues) and tag it accordingly. Cheers Internet!

### What this is?

This was an exercise to go through production with the objective of increase my pace and effectiveness. To go over the workflows;

- Logo creation
- UI design
- UX design
- Illustration Creation
- Imagery Curation and Editing
- Development

### Known areas for improvement

These are the things that didn't make in durning period I lotted for the projects, or features that need some more love.

- enhance the home page bean shopping experience (make if more capturing)
- lazy load main background image
- I would like to make scroll to next section
- I think there is room for some animations to enhance the experience
- A coffee video on repeat would be a nice enhancement
- Adding filter to the shop (this feature would be part of integrating with shopify
- Adding about coffee product page to give the audience more information about the coffee and enhance the experience

### Branding

I use the term branding here softly as this project did not require true branding. For example, community position, market differentiation from a business and social perspective.

#### Mark/Logo

Concept and designed by [design.Lucas Zapico](https://design.lucaszapico.space), there was a Pinterest search and some inspiration from my own person collection of Marks.

#### Color Palette

#### UX

UX was mocked in [Figma](https://figma.com) by [design.Lucas Zapico](https://design.lucaszapico.space). Though the user experience was relatively simple. I recently did a research pass on UX be practice for shopping experience and the main take away and driving force is to make the search and exploration of products navigable. This being said, I know it could be improved, but I am happy with the results from a power pass.
